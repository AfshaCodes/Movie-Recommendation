# Movie Recommendation System Project

This project builds a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches. It provides personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and viewing history. A Streamlit web application is included for easy user interaction.

## Features
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Loads and processes movie metadata and user ratings.
   - Handles missing data and feature extraction (e.g., genres, keywords).

2. **Recommendation Algorithms**:
   - **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies similar to a given movie based on metadata (e.g., genres, descriptions).
   - **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests movies based on user-item interaction data.
   - **Hybrid Approach**: Combines content-based and collaborative filtering for better results.

3. **Model Deployment**:
   - A Streamlit web app allows users to search for movies and receive personalized recommendations.
